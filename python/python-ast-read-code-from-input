a=input(":")

if you input ["a","\n"]
a should be '["a","\n"]'

how to turn that string into a python list
ast.literal_eval(a) would turn that into a python list
or use eval

in haskell, it does not have literal_eval or eval, since it's compiled language
you can use 
readMaybe "[1,2,3]" :: Maybe [Int] == Just [1,2,3]
